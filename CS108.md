# Unit test

## Basic

Use public interface

Few easy, obvious case

Call every method a few time differently

## Advanced

Happen when found new case in implementation

# Encapsulation

## Term

Take request but don't expose detail/implementation

Provide simple interface

## Technique

Code goes with data so object can do operation itself

Divide code around project nouns, create class and method, properties. Expose method based on client

## Interface

Object expose its abilities as public method for client's use

Should be organized based on client

## Implementation

Data structure,code detail to implement the interface

Complex, detailed vs simple, minimal interface

# OOP

Design toward client.

API and error guide client even without docs.

Multi constructor for common cases

Initialize all variable

Private data

Method as transaction

Must support public method with later release

Push code to data

# Design interface

Start with client viewpoint

Easy to be client

SOLVE CLIENT HIGH LEVEL PROBLEMS

Documentation should be short and intuitive

Operate on whole object

# Principle

Least surprise

Client use case analysis

Support common case which are easy to call and has reasonable default

# Inheritance

Don't use inheritance on everything

**OVERRIDE**: method in subclass has same signature as method in superclass. DO NOT COPY CODE.

**ABSTRACT**: can't be instantiated. Subclass must provide implementation

**POLYMORPHISM**: Different method depend on the class

# Patterns

- Factory: Create new instance without knowing implementation (call `createFoo()` instead of `Foo()` )
- Singleton: Have exactly one of something. Use static `getFoo()` to return pointer to the single object. Can use lazy evaluation.
- Iterator: Iterate over the items in collections without knowing the details(need start,inspect each item, when end)
- Adapter: wrap object has interface X to make it has interface Y
- Decorator: wrap object has interface X to make it has variant of X
- Observer: Observer get notify when something happen to observable
- MVC: mode store data, view display data, controller coordinate between 2
- Delegation: has a relationship

# Design idea

Divide and conquer

Good naming

DRY

KISS
