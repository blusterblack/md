# Ideas

- Consist of 2 part: task planner and time track

- each user has tasks

- each task has period

- each period has start,end,detail

- summary with charts, statistic

- able to start end task period with one click

- user choose stack then click start, timer will run, when they no longer work on that task then click end.

- tree structure task: projectA contains frontend and backend, backend contains task A, B, C, task A has x period,..., can see summary of backend, project A as well

- can only start end on leaf task, leaf: no sub task
